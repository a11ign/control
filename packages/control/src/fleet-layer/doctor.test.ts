// Relocated from packages/worker-fleet/src/doctor.test.ts by #3504: it reads control/lab/guards/the root, so it stays in the core and reads the fleet through the layer checkout at packages/worker-fleet.
/**
 * `doctor.mjs` never asked WHOSE dist a cross-package import resolves to (#256). Measured 2026-09-07: 5
 * of 26 live worktrees resolved `@a11ign/*` to the PRIMARY checkout's `dist` via a shared
 * `node_modules` symlink. Two agents running the identical command in adjacent worktrees could get
 * answers built from different code, and nothing anywhere said so.
 *
 * The remedy CLAUDE.md already recorded and nothing automated: "Verify WHOSE, by resolving the exact
 * specifier you import" -- not the package name, since a package can export subpaths from elsewhere and
 * resolving `@a11ign/judge` does not prove `@a11ign/judge/rules` came from the same tree.
 *
 * FRESHNESS IS NOT READ, AND NEVER AS A RAW MTIME COMPARISON. The check once asked `tsc --build --dry`; Rslib builds `judge` now (#3580), so its
 * tsconfig is `noEmit` and tsc has nothing to call up to date (#3810). What is read is what Rslib's output IS: the files `judge`'s `exports` promise
 * (`missingExportTargets`). A present but out-of-date `dist` is not caught, and the check says "present". The mtime comparison stays rejected: `git
 * checkout` moves source mtimes with no content change, so it would flag every worktree as stale the moment it switched branches (#256), the
 * "readiness command that cries wolf" `advise`'s own doc warns against.
