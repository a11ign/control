# @a11ign/control

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 01dc1b7: Syncs `packages/control` to `a11ign/a11ign` `2135079a0`, taken immediately before the delete (a11ign/a11ign#3506): `macsByHost` accepts a same-line comment (#3918), a lab job refuses a host with no laid `packages/lab` through the new `lab-laid-copy` (symlink-resolving entry guard, `run-job.yml` guard and its `a11y_lab.yml` variable, #3833), and `lab:job` drops the package manager's leading `--` (#3919).

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 295ece7: Syncs `packages/control` to `a11ign/a11ign` `50adf137b`, taken immediately before the delete (a11ign/a11ign#3506): the gate heartbeat (`gate-heartbeat.mjs` with its playbook and two unit files), `fleet:auto-off` judging a laid control against `pinned.control` (#3914) and its refusal clock (`since`, #3859), the auto-off mirror test, and the lab's layer declaration (`pinned.lab`, #3505).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- b5bd7e5: Carries `a11ign/a11ign` #3837 (#3289): the qualification-status poster uses the host's ambient `gh` and has no token file, and `lab:job` gains `--qualify-sha` (new `qualification-run.mjs`).

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7a0cf6e: Synced to `a11ign/a11ign` `eae7806ca`: five commits that touched `packages/control` there after `v0.1.0` was copied (#3534, #3447, #3761, #3504). The tag's layer declaration now has the `screenreader-fleet` layer, `layer-checkouts` is an export, and the 27 tests #3504 relocated (`src/fleet-layer/`) are here.

## 0.1.0

First release from its own repository. `packages/control` moved out of `a11ign/a11ign` with its history (375 commits, internal addresses redacted from every file and commit message), and releases itself from here: a merge carrying a changeset is tagged `v<version>` with a GitHub Release.
